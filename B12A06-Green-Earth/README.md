1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var → function-scoped, re-declarable, re-assignable.
let → block-scoped, not re-declarable, re-assignable.
const → block-scoped, not re-declarable, not re-assignable.





2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

map() → returns a new array with transformed values.
forEach() → executes a function on each element, returns nothing.
filter() → returns a new array with elements that match a condition.





3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Shorter syntax for writing functions.
Do not bind their own this (useful inside callbacks).
example- const add = (a, b) => a + b;





4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Extracts values from arrays or objects into variables.







5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Strings written with backticks (`).
Support variables & expressions with ${ }.
